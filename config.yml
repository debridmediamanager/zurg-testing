# List of directory definitions and their filtering rules
directories:
  # Configuration for TV shows
  shows:
    group: media # directories on different groups have duplicates of the same torrent
    group_order: 1
    filters:
      - regex: /season[\s\.]?\d/i          # Capture torrent names with the term 'season' in any case
      - regex: /saison[\s\.]?\d/i          # For non-English namings
      - regex: /stagione[\s\.]?\d/i        # if there's french, there should be italian too
      - regex: /s\d\d/i           # Capture common season notations like S01, S02, etc.
      - regex: /\btv/i            # anything that has TV in it is a TV show, right?
      - contains: complete
      - contains: seasons
      - any_file_inside_regex: /s\d\d/i

      - any_file_inside_regex: /episode.?\d{1,4}/i
      - any_file_inside_regex: /ep.?.?\d{1,4}/i

  # Configuration for movies
  movies:
    group: media # because movies and shows are in the same group,
    group_order: 2 # and shows has a lower group_order number than movies, all torrents that doesn't fall into shows will fall into movies
    filters:
      - regex: /.*/ # you cannot leave a directory without filters because it will not have any torrents in it
